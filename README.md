## Project Name: GeoGuard
Private cameras in businesses, homes, and institutions play a crucial role in enhancing public safety and crime detection. Many private cameras lack clear locations, making it difficult for the police to efficiently access relevant video footage during investigations in specific crime-prone areas.

### How to Setup Locally

### Modules
#### 1. Camera Registration Module:
- Enrollment of cameras and data storage.
- Administration of geotagged data.

#### 2. Module for Geotagging:
- Using the Google Maps API to geotag the approved camera area and introduction.
- Interactive map will help the Control center module to strategically plan the layout to avoid any casualties.

#### 3. Object Detection and failure detection: 
- Analysis of video streams from registered cameras.
- Identification of specific objects using deep learning and object detection.
- Detection of camera failures.

#### 4. Alerting:
- Real-time communication and alert generation based on detected objects.
- Notification of camera failures to the Owner and Control Center.

#### 5. Command and Control Center Module:
- Confirmation of camera registration and alert subscription.
- Map-based interface for displaying alerts and camera locations.
- Interface for contacting camera owners, requesting access to video footage, and dispatching police units.
- Reception and processing of alerts from the Object Detection and Failure Detection Module.


### Goals to achieve
- **Planning on switching to SQL based database for better scalability**
- **Achieving camera feed from local IP to public IP**
- **Implementing cloud-based storage to store CCTV footage using different encryption and compression techniques**

### Achievements
- Qualified for preliminary round of IEEE YESIST12. 

- Currently developing under guidance of Rajasthan Police (Finalist at Rajasthan Police Hackathon 1.0)

- Presented project idea for City institute of disaster Management(BMC)
